# hello-world
My first repository, for testing purposes.

I'll probably use this to keep track of the learning tools I find as I get deeper into C# beyond just working in Unity, as well as initial work in Python.

First impressions of the Android apps I've found is that there are some good ones out there, but they all cost a lot of money.
